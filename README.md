# Decentralized Lending and Microfinance Smart Contract

## Overview

The Decentralized Lending and Microfinance Smart Contract is a blockchain-based solution built on the Stacks protocol. It facilitates a secure, transparent, and efficient lending system, enabling lenders to provide liquidity and borrowers to access loans without intermediaries. The contract includes robust state management and error handling to ensure safe and predictable operations.

## Contract Structure

### Constants
- **Error Codes**: Defined for common issues like invalid inputs, insufficient balance, or unauthorized access (e.g., `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-BALANCE`, `ERR-LOAN-EXISTS`).
- **Loan Limits**: Minimum and maximum limits for loan amounts, durations, and interest rates.
- **Blockchain Assumptions**: Constants for estimating time-related parameters (e.g., blocks per day).

### Data Variables
- **Contract State**: Indicates whether the contract is active or paused.
- **Pool Metrics**: Tracks the total funds available in the pool and the number of active loans.

### Data Maps
- **Loan Records**: Stores details of loans, including principal, interest rate, term, repayment status, and borrower reputation.
- **Lender Contributions**: Tracks the amount and timing of each lenderâ€™s contributions.

## Testing

### Unit Testing
- Validate error scenarios such as invalid loan requests or over-contributions.
- Test all edge cases for repayment calculations and pool updates.

### Integration Testing
